        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parslet, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer covered for about 1.5 horus, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cook lasagne noodles in boiling water for 8 minutes and rinse with cold water</li>
